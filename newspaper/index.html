            <h1> ELECTRIC CARS : THE FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION</h1><br>
            <img src="elec.jpg" class="car">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, 
                using energy stored in rechargeable batteries. The first practical electric cars 
                were produced in the 1880s.[1] Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century 
                and early 20th century, until advances in internal combustion engines, electric 
                starters in particular, and mass production of cheaper petrol (gasoline) and diesel 
                vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
                While an electric car's power source is not explicitly an on-board battery, electric 
                cars with motors powered by other energy sources are typically referred to by a 
                different name. An electric car carrying solar panels to power it is a solar car, 
                and an electric car powered by a gasoline generator is a form of hybrid car.

            Usually, books about positive thinking or optimism will reveal how an improved 
            attitude will also lead to a more successful and healthy live. Health books tend 
            to have at least a significant part on spirituality.

        <b>India now fifth worst-affected by Covid-19, surpasses Spain</b><br>
        <font>India is now among the five worst-affected countries by the coronavirus disease. 
            It achieved the grim milestone on Saturday evening when the total tally of infections
             reached 2,45,670. Spain so far has recorded 2,41,310 cases, according to Johns
              Hopkins University.</font>
        <br><br>
        <b>  These 10 states have 84% of India’s Covid-19 cases</b>
        <font>
            Ten states with the highest number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) account for 84% of the country’s tally and 95% of the fatalities.
            These states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka and Bihar.
            However, a higher number of Covid-19 tests per million population by a state may not necessarily mean more confirmed cases detected or high fatality rates.

        <b>Hwaja Yunus custodial death: Four suspended Mumbai cops reinstated</b>

        <font>SIXTEEN YEARS after being suspended for their alleged involvement in the custodial death 
            of 27-year-old Khwaja Yunus in January 2003, four policemen were reinstated on Friday and 
            resumed duty on Saturday in the city’s police force.
            Assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and police constables Rajendra Tiwari, 
            Sunil Desai resumed duty in the local arms unit. Constable Rajaram Nikam was reinstated in 
            the motor vehicle department. The four, suspended in different months in 2004, continue
